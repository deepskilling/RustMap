# ✅ Nmap Features – Implementation Checklist

## 🔍 Port Scanning
- [ ] TCP Connect Scan (full connection)
- [ ] SYN (Half-Open) Scan (stealthy, faster)
- [ ] UDP Scan (detect UDP services)
- [ ] FIN, Xmas, Null Scans (firewall/IDS evasion)
- [ ] Ping Sweep / Host Discovery (ICMP, ARP, TCP/UDP probes)

## 🌐 Service Detection
- [ ] Service identification (map ports → services like HTTP, SSH)
- [ ] Version detection (software version & patch level)

## 💻 OS Detection
- [ ] OS fingerprinting (family, version, device type)

## 🛡 Firewall / IDS Evasion
- [ ] Packet fragmentation (bypass filters)
- [ ] Decoy scans (hide real scanning source)
- [ ] Spoofed source IP (mask identity)
- [ ] Timing templates (Paranoid → Insane, balance stealth vs speed)

## 🧩 Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
- [ ] Vulnerability detection scripts (CVE checks, misconfigurations)
- [ ] Brute-force authentication scripts (SSH, FTP, etc.)
- [ ] Exploitation/verification scripts (e.g., Heartbleed)

## 📊 Output & Reporting
- [ ] Normal output (human-readable)
- [ ] Grepable output (automation-friendly)
- [ ] XML / JSON output (machine-readable, integrations)
- [ ] Visual mapping (Zenmap GUI)

## ⚡ Performance & Flexibility
- [ ] Adjustable scan speeds (stealthy → aggressive)
- [ ] Parallel scanning (large networks)

## 🧭 Additional Tools
- [ ] Traceroute (map hop-by-hop path)
- [ ] IPv6 support (modern networks)
- [ ] Scripted vulnerability scanning (via NSE)


using the nmap_features_checklist file, implement the application in rust based on SOLID archtecture. Create a framework for logging, error handling, use sqlite database for storing any data. implement a configuration file for all  setting, system wide variables

🏆 Architecture Highlights
This framework demonstrates professional Rust development with:
🎯 SOLID Principles: Clean, maintainable, extensible design
⚡ Async Architecture: High-performance concurrent operations
🔧 Modular Design: Components can be developed independently
📊 Comprehensive Monitoring: Logging, metrics, health checks
🛡️ Robust Error Handling: Graceful failure handling and recovery
📈 Production Ready: Database persistence, configuration management, CLI interface
The framework provides a solid foundation for implementing a full-featured network scanning tool equivalent to nmap, with all the infrastructure, patterns, and interfaces needed for professional development.
